# Project: Zephyr Agent

Zephyr Agent is a Rust-based NL2GraphQL system.

## Commands
- Build: `cargo build`
- Run: `cargo run`
- Test: `cargo test`
- Lint: `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- Format: `cargo fmt`

## Rules
- Keep logic deterministic where possible.
- Preserve PlanV2 schema grounding and validation behavior.
- Do not bypass GraphQL validation.
- Add or update tests when changing parsing, planning, repair, or execution logic.
- Prefer clear Rust errors over silent fallback behavior.
- Do not use heuristics or hardoced labels, Use the existing schema/SLS field-role system to decide display labels.
- Do not edit schemas/consumer_schema.graphql. 

## Architecture
- Natural language input is converted into PlanV2.
- PlanV2 is validated against schema/context.
- The system generates GraphQL, repairs when needed, executes, ranks, and grounds the final answer.

## Before finishing
- Run `cargo fmt`.
- Run relevant tests.
- Explain what changed and why.

# Workflow Orchestration

## 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

## 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

## 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

## 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

## 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

## 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

# Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

# Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
